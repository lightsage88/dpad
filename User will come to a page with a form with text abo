IGN api key  = 55de1e00546c499eb2c897bc60ee276c

Giant Bomb api key = 65afeff37ed837e24d6273ee389126d1df1a195c 

FIRST WE DO A SEARCH
/search/?api_key=xxx&format=json&query=Star%20Fox%20Zero&resources=game
**from here we will get the site-detail-url key's value of 
https://www.giantbomb.com/star-fox-zero/3030-46584/
We will slice the last character and everything before the first unmber to get the 9 digit identifying number.

		gameToken = 3030-46584 (for Star Fox Zero)
	

Then we do a QUERY (not a search) using the identifying number we got. So we get the game we are looking for.
http://www.giantbomb.com/api/[RESOURCE-TYPE]/[RESOURCE-ID]/?api_key=[YOUR-KEY]&format=[RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT]&field_list=[COMMA-SEPARATED-LIST-OF-RESOURCE-FIELDS]
//
http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46584/?api_key=xxx&format=json

we want our field_list to include:
*name // will give a string with the title of the game (e.g. 'Star Fox Zero')

*original_release_date  //We can get the date and strip un-needed chars from it

*image // We can get thumb_url for our pics :)

*developers // get the first one for this game it is PlatinumGames

		get api_detail_url, we will strip the last character and ones before the number
		companyNumber = #;

*reviews // get site_detail_url which is a string that is an address, we will strip the last character and everything before the special number we want *****we will save this for later

		get api_detail_url, we will strip the last character and the ones before the number
		reviewNumber = #

*platforms // we get the key of 'name'...as that will yield "Wii U"
